How well do you know your Pokemon?

I created a Pokemon Quiz website, inspired by the popular mobile game, <i>Pokemon Go</i>.
## Installation
No installation required!
## How To Play
<b>Take the Pokemon Quiz</b> @ https://aurorua.github.io/pokemon-quiz/

Currently, there are a total of 25 Quiz questions - one question per Pokemon from Gen I (126 more to go!).

Answer each question correctly to receive <b>Quiz Points (QP)</b>! But if you answer incorrectly, you take damage from the Pokemon in question! Use <b>Potions</b> to heal your <b>Hit Points (HP)</b>! <i>You can hover over or tap on the Pokemon to reveal how much damage it will deal, if you answer incorrectly.</i>

Once you complete the Quiz, you will earn a <b>medal</b> based on how many questions you answered correctly!

<i>Have fun!</i>
